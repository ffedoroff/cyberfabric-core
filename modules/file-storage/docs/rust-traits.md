## Overview

The FileStorage SDK exposes one consumer-facing trait — `FileStorageClient` — registered in the ModKit `ClientHub`. The shape of the trait follows the in-process SDK convention used by `simple-user-settings-sdk::SimpleUserSettingsClientV1`: every method takes a `&SecurityContext` first, every method is `async`, every method returns `Result<_, FileStorageError>`.

The trait is built around the **opaque `FileId` (UUID)** as the canonical handle, per [ADR-0002](./ADR/0002-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-opaque-file-ids.md). All operations on an existing file address it by `file_id`; only `create_presigned_url` accepts a logical `file_path` (and turns it into a fresh `file_id`). Re-uploads against an existing file go through `create_presigned_overwrite_url`, which keeps the same `file_id`.

`read_file` and `put_file` both use an idiomatic async byte-chunk stream (`Stream<Item = Result<Bytes, _>>`) — the same shape that axum, reqwest, and tonic use for HTTP request/response bodies, so adapters can pipe bytes between FileStorage and HTTP without intermediate buffering. `put_file` is an in-process SDK convenience that drives the full presign-first lifecycle from a `Stream<Bytes>`; in P1 the implementation is a stub (`unimplemented!()`) and there is no REST surface.

`reconcile` is the explicit reconciliation primitive — it HEADs the backend, pulls the authoritative `s3_etag`, `s3_version_id`, and the entire user-visible metadata mirror (Content-Type, Content-Disposition, every `x-amz-meta-<k>` header), and writes the row in a single conditional UPDATE. Concurrent reconciles converge by construction (HEAD-first, conditional-UPDATE second). See [ADR-0004](./ADR/0004-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-self-healing-reconciliation.md). The companion REST endpoint is `POST /files/{id}/meta/reconcile` and rejects `If-Match` with `400`.

The companion [ADR-0001](./ADR/0001-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-s3-no-metadata-db.md), [ADR-0003](./ADR/0003-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-presigned-put-sigv4.md), and [ADR-0005](./ADR/0005-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-versioning-and-aba.md) explain the metadata-database decision, the choice of presigned PUT (SigV4) for the direct-transfer path, and the bucket-versioning + ABA-CAS strategy.

## SDK Models

Defined in `file-storage-sdk/src/models.rs`. Aligned with REST API schemas ([openapi.yaml](./openapi.yaml)) and follow the platform DDD pattern observed in `simple-user-settings-sdk/src/models.rs`.

```rust
use bytes::Bytes;
use modkit_macros::domain_model;
use std::collections::BTreeMap;
use std::pin::Pin;

/// `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-etag-content-only`). Used for
/// conditional updates (HTTP `If-Match`-style optimistic concurrency)
/// on routes that opt in.

/// One backend declared in the FileStorage roster (`GET /storages`).
/// In P1 the descriptor declares the kind, the role flags, the

## SDK Traits

Defined in `file-storage-sdk/src/api.rs`.

```rust
use async_trait::async_trait;
use modkit_security::SecurityContext;

/// Consumer-facing client trait registered in `ClientHub` by the
/// `file-storage` module. Follows the in-process SDK convention used
/// by `simple-user-settings-sdk::SimpleUserSettingsClientV1`.
///
/// Consumers obtain the client from `ClientHub`:
/// ```ignore
/// let files = hub.get::<dyn FileStorageClient>()?;
/// let backends = files.list_backends(&ctx).await?;
/// ```
///
/// Lifecycle of a file (the canonical "presign-first" flow):
///
/// 1. The application's own backend (e.g. chat) validates the request
///    against its domain rules.
/// 2. It calls `create_presigned_url` and receives a
///    `(file_id, upload_url, etag_pinned, expires_at)` tuple —
///    FileStorage has persisted a `PendingUpload` row.
/// 3. The end-client `PUT`s bytes directly to `upload_url` (SigV4 PUT
///    against the S3-compatible backend).
/// 4. The application's backend confirms the upload by calling
///    `reconcile(file_id)`. FileStorage HEADs the backend, pulls the
///    authoritative `s3_etag`, `s3_version_id`, and metadata mirror,
///    writes them into the row, and returns the post-commit
///    `FileInfo`.
/// 5. From here on every consumer references the file by `file_id`
///    (and an optional `etag` for optimistic concurrency).
///
/// **Re-uploading the same file** — the application's backend calls
/// `create_presigned_overwrite_url(file_id, params)` (no `meta`
/// argument). The server pins the row's current metadata into the
/// presigned PUT, the end-client re-PUTs to the same backend object
/// key, the application calls `reconcile(file_id)`. The row's
/// `etag` rotates to the new bytes; metadata is unchanged.
///
/// **Changing metadata** — `put_file_info(file_id, update, etag?)`.
/// The server merges the update into the row, then issues
/// `CopyObject` self-copy with `MetadataDirective: REPLACE` to
/// synchronize S3 user-metadata and `Content-Type` /
/// `Content-Disposition` to the new values, then UPDATEs the DB.
/// Optional `If-Match` becomes a strong CAS over both DB and S3.
///
/// All methods that take an `etag` argument honour it as

## Internal Adapter Trait — `StorageBackend`

Lives inside the implementation crate (`file-storage/src/infra/backend.rs`), not in the public SDK. Captured here so implementers can plan the split described in DESIGN §3.2.

The adapter trait is the seam between the FileStorage core (which owns the `file_storage` SQL schema, the upload coordinator, and authz integration) and a concrete byte store. It deliberately does **not** know about `file_id`, `OwnerRef`, or authz — those are resolved one layer up. The adapter only ever sees a `BackendObjectKey` (an opaque `String` minted by the core) and bytes. It also does NOT know about `gts_file_type` — that field is DB-only and never crosses the adapter boundary.

```rust
use async_trait::async_trait;
use bytes::Bytes;

/// Opaque per-backend object key, minted by the FileStorage core. For
/// `s3-compatible` backends it is derived deterministically from the
/// file's `file_id` (per ADR-0002). The adapter treats it as an opaque
/// string.
pub type BackendObjectKey = String;

/// Backend-side metadata returned by `head_object` and by the
/// `open_read` helper. `s3_etag` and `s3_version_id` are the raw
/// values (without surrounding quotes for the etag). The metadata
/// bag (`content_type`, `content_disposition`, `user_metadata`) is
/// what `reconcile` pulls into the row.

## ClientHub Registration

Single implementation, single registration:

```rust
let svc: Arc<FileStorageService> = Arc::new(FileStorageService::new(/* … */));
ctx.client_hub().register::<dyn FileStorageClient>(svc.clone());
```

## Usage Example — full lifecycle

```rust
use file_storage_sdk::{
    FileStorageClient, FileMeta, OwnerRef,
    PresignDownloadItem, UrlParams, ReconcileResult,
};
use modkit_security::SecurityContext;
use std::collections::BTreeMap;
use uuid::Uuid;

let files = hub.get::<dyn FileStorageClient>()?;

// 1. Application backend creates a presigned upload URL after running
//    its own validations.
let owner = OwnerRef {
    tenant_id: ctx.tenant_id(),
    owner_id: ctx.subject_id(),
};
let meta = FileMeta {
    name: "plan.pdf".into(),
    mime_type: "application/pdf".into(),
    gts_file_type: "gts.x.fstorage.file.type.v1~x.docmgmt.reports.file.v1~".into(),
    size_bytes: Some(18_274),
    custom_metadata: BTreeMap::new(),
};
let handle = files
    .create_presigned_url(
        &ctx,
        Some(s3_prod_backend_id),  // or None to land on the tenant's default_private backend
        owner.clone(),
        "chat/threads/abc/plan.pdf",
        meta,
        UrlParams {
            expires_in_seconds: 600,
            content_disposition: None,
            content_type_override: None,
            allowed_client_cidrs: vec![],
        },
    )
    .await?;
// hand handle.upload_url + handle.etag_pinned to the frontend …

// 2. After the frontend reports the upload completed, the application
//    backend reconciles the row.
let ReconcileResult { info, s3_etag, s3_version_id } =
    files.reconcile(&ctx, handle.file_id).await?;
// `info.etag` is the raw S3 ETag for the new bytes; `info.version_id`
// matches whatever S3 returned (None on non-versioning backends).

// 3. Later, another module asks for downloadable URLs. The URL is
//    SigV4-signed (or a bare HTTPS URL if the file lives in a
//    public-read backend) and time-limited per
//    `params.expires_in_seconds`.
let outcomes = files
    .presign_urls(
        &ctx,
        vec![PresignDownloadItem {
            file_id: info.file_id,
            params: UrlParams {
                expires_in_seconds: 300,
                content_disposition: None,
                content_type_override: None,
                allowed_client_cidrs: vec![],
            },
            etag: Some(info.etag.clone()),
            version_id: None, // current bytes
        }],
    )
    .await?;
```

## Usage Example — variant B re-upload

```rust
// Application backend re-asks the user to upload a fresh version of
// an existing file (same file_id).
let handle = files
    .create_presigned_overwrite_url(
        &ctx,
        existing_file_id,
        UrlParams {
            expires_in_seconds: 600,
            content_disposition: None,
            content_type_override: None,
            allowed_client_cidrs: vec![],
        },
    )
    .await?;
// Frontend PUTs to handle.upload_url with the headers FileStorage
// pinned from the row's CURRENT metadata. After PUT acknowledged:
let ReconcileResult { info, .. } = files.reconcile(&ctx, existing_file_id).await?;
// info.etag now reflects the new bytes; metadata is unchanged.
```

## Usage Example — in-process streaming read

```rust
use futures::StreamExt;

let mut handle = files.read_file(&ctx, file_id, Some(&etag)).await?;
println!("downloading {} ({} bytes)", handle.info.meta.name, handle.info.size_bytes);
while let Some(chunk) = handle.bytes.next().await {
    let chunk = chunk?;
    sink.write_all(&chunk).await?; // tokio AsyncWrite sink
}
```

## Trait Hierarchy Summary

| Trait | Methods | Consumers | ClientHub key |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| `FileStorageClient` | 12 (full P1 surface: backends, file lifecycle including `reconcile`, both initial and variant-B presign, streaming I/O including the deferred `put_file` stub, batched presign) | CyberFabric modules via ClientHub, REST adapter | `dyn FileStorageClient` |
| `StorageBackend` (internal) | 6 (adapter boundary; `head_object` is required by `reconcile` and the strong-CAS variant of `put_file_info`; `copy_object_self` is required by `put_file_info`'s DB+S3 sync; presigned URLs are batch-first on the GET side, single-shot on the PUT side per ADR-0003) | `BackendRouter`, `UploadCoordinator` | — (not registered in ClientHub) |

The 12 SDK methods are: `list_backends`, `create_presigned_url`, `create_presigned_overwrite_url`, `reconcile`, `get_file_info`, `put_file_info`, `delete_file`, `list_files`, `read_file`, `put_file`, `presign_urls` (REST counterpart `presign-batch` aggregates the two upload variants and the download variant). The internal adapter declares `open_read`, `head_object`, `delete_object`, `issue_presigned_put`, `copy_object_self`, and `issue_presigned_gets`.
